Time Bank AppHERE

Introduction:
This is a mobile based application where people on this platform can trade hours as local currency. This system provides a means for people to request different services and provide diverse services to people on this platform. When a user needs a request, the request is posted which is broadcasted and made available to all users of the application. The request posted includes how much time the requester is willing to trade for the service.
 
The major roles of this system are:
• The requester who will need a service
• The responder who is available to provide service to the requester
 
The major use cases of the system are:
• User signs up with name, location, description
• Requester posts a service
• Responder browses through all available services request
• Responder views approximate time to a service location
• Requester rates the service provided by a responder
